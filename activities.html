                    The project will be held in Ioannina and will gather 18 youth workers coming from 6 Program
                    countries. The participants that the project will gather are all members of the youth partner organisations,
                    interested to develop their competences and to multiply the effects of the project within their local communities.
                    <br><br>
                    The target group is composed of <b>youth workers, trainers, motivated youth on the subject or project managers all actively involved in the youth sector</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    The experience of the participants will be valued as a resource for the whole group in order to
                    achieve transfer of competences and best practices sharing. This will be essential for the sustainability of the
                    project, to develop further training and workshop network at a local level and between the involved countries. The
                    course will be based on the specific learning needs of the participants.
                    <br><br>
                    The team of trainers will create a learning and exchanging space, where participants are encouraged and coached to use their creativity and personal
                    reflection <b> to train, work with youth, design new workshops and achieve development of themselves at personal and professional levels </b> .

                    The partner organisations will be responsible to select candidates via registration forms which will
                    be specifically
                    created for the project needs. <b> The criteria used for selection will be :</b> <br>
                    - The <b> motivation</b> of the candidate to attend the course
                    <br>
                    - The  <b>experience</b> of the candidate regarding the project topic in order to make sure he/she could
                    contribute and be a valuable resource for the group
                    <br>
                    - The <b>ability to express their ideas in English</b> to ensure a good quality of exchanges during the
                    project. From experience we know that it is not necessary that they have an excellent level of English. Some good
                    basis in English and motivated participants are enough to enable communication.<br>
                    - The candidates must be over 18 years old
                    <br>
                    - The level of<b>  involvement</b> of the candidate within the partner organisation in order to ensure
                    quality dissemination process and multiplying effect of the results. The participants will be selected on the basis of
                    their current activities as local trainers, youth workers or youth involved in their own community, their will and
                    interest to get involve in this training topic and their further will to extend the impacts of this training in their own community. 
                    
                    Thus each national team will consist of three people. We also would like social and cultural
                    diversity in the national groups as much as possible to widen the impacts of the training, have different point of views and impact different levels of societies and communities.
                </p>
                <p class="wrs">
                  <span class="tcolor"> The program of the raining course "WRS" will be based on <b>non formal educational methods</b> which
                    combine theoretical and practical components and conducted using a highly participatory approach in order to
                    cover all the aspects of the theme.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Special attention will be paid to the fact that the competences and the
                    knowledge gained and transmitted during the course remain sustainable and transferable. This will be achieved by setting up
                    enough space and time for reflection and evaluation, by providing comprehensive documentation, handouts and
                    guidance from the trainersâ€™ team.
                    <br><br>
                    A finished workshop pack will be given to the participants at the end of the training so that they can use it at the 
                    return in their own countries. The participants will then do a training course in their respective countries to teach
                    to other youth workers training skills and tools on the subject. The selection of participants is
                    one of the fundamental points in this project to spread the impacts of the training at local levels.
                    <br><br>
                    We wanted to work with organisations already used to organise European projects for youth, involved in their own country in
                    the matter of intercultural dialogue and European citizenship and that have a strong network among the youth
                    to perpetuate the impacts of our training.
                    Therefore, each organisation will be responsible for
                    recruiting sparticipants and we already invited them to get in touch with them.
